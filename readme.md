## Setup

### How to run on local environment

1. First of all, copy the `example` file to `.env.development.local` file
2. Fill the local environment variables with the correct values
3. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
4. Create a database with value that already filled from env file
5. Run migrations with `npm run migrate`
6. And last but not least, run the server with `npm run dev` as development mode

### How to setup and run tests

1. First of all, copy the `example` file to `.env.test.local` file
2. Fill the local environment variables with the correct values
3. Install the dependencies with `npm install` if you don't have any dependencies installed
4. Create a database with value that already filled from env file
5. Run migrations with `npm run migrate:test`
6. And last but not least, run the test `npm run test` with jest as test mode

### How to deploy on production environment

1. First of all, copy the `example` file to .env.production.local file
2. Fill the local environment variables with the correct values
3. Run and deploy with current exist Dockerfile and Docker Compose file (for test you can use Railway)

### How to deploy production with kubernetes (kinD)

1. First of all, copy the `example` file to .env.production.local file
2. Use Docker Desktop Kubernetes or you can use kinD to run the cluster
   - [Docker Desktop Kubernetes](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/)
   - [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
     - create a cluster with `kind create cluster --file cluster-config.yml`. The default cluster name is `kind`
3. build your docker image with `docker image build -t YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/sejutacita:latest .`
   - or use my image at my docker repo [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bungambohlah/sejutacita)
4. create a deployment or pod with `kubectl apply -f pod.yml`
5. create a service with `kubectl apply -f service.yml`
6. check all the pod and service with `kubectl get all` and make sure status is `Running`
7. Access your project with port from kind cluster master port (example is 30000). Then run with [localhost:30000](http://localhost:30000/)

### Screenshot Kubernetes with KinD

Apply pod and service with `kubectl apply -f pod.yml` and `kubectl apply -f service.yml`
